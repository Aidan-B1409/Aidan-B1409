### Hi there 👋
I'm an AI/CS doctoral student @ Oregon State University. My research focuses on real-world, practical applications of machine learning. Currently, I work on the development of [image segmentation models for food and food waste recognition](https://github.com/Soundbendor/FoodWasteDetect). I led the design and development of the [Smart Compost Bin](https://github.com/Soundbendor/food-detection-embedded) for automatic household food waste measurement. In the past, I developed a [BERT-based sentiment analysis NLP model for music emotion recognition from social media discourse](https://github.com/Soundbendor/music_discourse_prediction).
