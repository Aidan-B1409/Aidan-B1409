### Hi there 👋
I'm a C.S. student @ Oregon State with a focus on machine learning engineering. I'm currently working on social media sentiment analysis & emotion understanding with deep NLP. I've always had a heavy focus on software engineering, and like writing clean, maintainable, and efficent solutions for data science problems.
